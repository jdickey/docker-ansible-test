# Reinitialize a Droplet, set up Docker, and get our app running in it
#
# Ensure that:
# 1. An SSH key is present (see `digital_ocean` module docs);
# 2. A named Droplet exists, waiting for it to be running;
# 3. The regular user exists;
# 4. The users `authorized_keys` file exists with correct contents;
# 5. The `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file has the correct contents;
# 6. The SSH daemon is reloaded;
# 7. The `apt` package cache is updated/upgraded;
# 8. The `ufw` firewall is configured correctly;
# 9. Docker is installed and available to the regular user;
# 10. The desired Docker image has been pulled;
# 11. The desired Docker image has been started;
# 12. Content is available from the Web server hosted by the named Droplet;
# 13. The desired Floating IP already exists;
# 14. The desired Floating IP is reassigned to the named Droplet;
# 15. Content is available from the Web server addressed by the Floating IP.
